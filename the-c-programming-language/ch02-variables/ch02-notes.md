Chapter 2 : Types, Operators, and Expressions
---------------------------------------------
Variables/constants are basic data objects manipulated in a program. Operators
specify what is to be done to them. Expressions combine variables+operators to
compute new values.

### 2.1 Variable Names
First character in a variable name **must be a letter (or _)**. Usually, lower
case for variable names, UPPER CASE for symbolic constants. Keywords like `if,
else, int, float` must be in lower case. Short name for loop indices, long name
for external variables.

Only first 31 characters are significant in a variable name.

### 2.2 Data Types and Sizes
Only 4 basic data types :
  * `char` (1 byte)
  * `int`
  * `float` (single-precision floating point)
  * `double` (double-precision floating point)

Can add the specifier `short` and `long` for `int`. `short` is at least 16 bits,
`long` is at least 32 bits and `int` is either 16 or 32 bits. `float` is 32
bits, `double` is 64 bits and `long double` is 128 bits.

Can also add the qualifier `unsigned` (positive or zero) or `signed` for `int`
and `char`.

```C
printf("%d") -> int/short/char
printf("%u") -> unsigned int/unsigned short/unsigned char
printf("%ld") -> long
printf("%lu") -> unsigned long
```

### 2.3 Constants
`long` constants are written with a terminal `l` or `L`. Unsigned contstants are
written with a terminal `u` or `U` (`ul` or `UL` for `unsigned long`).
Floating-point constants are written with a terminal `f` or `F`. Scientific
notation can be used `1e-2`.

Integers can be specified in **octal** (with a leading `0` like `037`) and
**hexadecimal** (with a leading `0x` like `0x1f`).

`0XFUL` = `unsigned long` equal to 15.

**Character constants** are integers, written as a simple character (`'r'`). Its
value is the numeric value of the character in the machine's character set. We
can define character constant in :
  * octal (`\O13` for vertical tab)
  * hexedecimal (`\x7`)

`\0` represents the character with value zero, the **null character**. Its value
is 0.

**String constants** (or _string literal_) are sequences of zero or more
characters surrounded by double quotes like `"hello world"`. String constants
are _concatenated at compile time_ so `"hello" ", world"` is equivalent to
`"hello, world"`. **This can be useful to split long string on several lines.**
Be careful, `'x' (int) != "x" (string)`. The storage needed to store a string is
LEN+1 (need to store the implicit `\0` character). Function to compute length of
a string :

```C
/* strlen: return length of s, excluding the \0 character. Available in <string.h> */
int strlen(char s[])
{
    int i;
    while (s[i] != '\0')
        ++i;
    return i;
}
```

**Enumeration constants** : a list of constant integer values like `enum boolean
{NO, YES};` (alternative to `#define`). First name in an enumeration has value
0, the second one has value 1 and so on. We can also specify the value of each
element in an enumeration :
```C
enum escape {BELL = '\a', BACKSPACE = '\b', TAB = '\t',
             NEWLINE = '\n', VTAB = '\v', RETURN = '\r' };
enum months {JAN = 1, FEB,..., DEC}; /* FEB = 2 because enum starts with 1 */
```
Advantage over `#define` => values are generated automatically.

### 2.4 Declarations
A declaration specifies a **type** and contains a **list of one or more
variables** of that type :
```C
int lower, upper, step;
char c, line[1000];
```

We can also directly initialize a variable in its declaration :
```C
int limit = MAXLINE-1;
float eps = 1.0e-5;
```

Initializer must be a constant expression. *External* and *static* variables are
**initialized to zero** by default. *Automatic* variables with no explicit
initialization have **garbage value**.

Add the keyword `const` to specify that the variable value will not be
modified (same thing goes with an array). We can also add `const` in a function
argument list to indicate that an array will not be modified.
```C
const double = 2.71828182845905;

int strlen(const char[]);
```

### 2.5 Arithmetic Operators
They are `+, -, *, /, %`. We **cannot** apply `%` on **float and double**. `*, /
,%` have higher precedence than `+, -`.

### 2.6 Relational and Logical Operators
 * **Relational operators** : `>, >=, <, <=`, all the same precedence. Also the
   `==` and `!=` but they have higher precedence than the others.

 * **Logical operators** : `&&` and `||`. Evaluation of an expresion stops when
   the output of evaluation is known (_passive evaluation_).

It is better to use `if (!valid)` than `if (valid == 0)`. The precedence of `!=`
is higher than assignement, that's why we need parentheses in `(c = getchar())
!= '\n'`.

### 2.7 Type Conversions
In `a+b`, if `a` and `b` are not of the same type, one of them is
**automatically** converted, usually the "narrower" becomes "wider" (like Ì£`int`
to `float`) so no loss of information. Most of the time, `char` is used as an
integer :
```C
/* atoi: converts s to integer */
int atoi(char s[])
{
    int i, n;

    for (n = 0, i = 0; s[i] >= '0' && s[i] <= '9'; ++i)
        n = 10 * n + (s[i] - '0'); /* implicit char to int conversion */

    return n;
}

/* lower: turn c into a lowercase letter */
int lower(char c)
{
    if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z')
        return c + 'a' - 'A';
    else
        return c;
}
```
Some conversion function are implemented in `<ctype.h>` :
  * `tolower(c)`
  * `isdigit(c)`

**BE CAREFUL** : when converting a `char` with leftmost bit set to 1 to `int`,
it can become negative (depends on the architecture of the machine). It is
better to indicate if such char is `signed` or `unsigned`.

`float` are not automatically converted to `double` (but most of the functions
in `<math.h>` use double). The main reason to use `float` is to save storage in
large arrays, or save time in computations (less expensive than using `double`).

Conversion rules :
  * if either operand is `long double`, convert the other to `long double`
  * if either operand is `double`, convert the other to `double`
  * if either operand is `float`, convert the other to `float`
  * convert `char` and `short` to `int`
  * if either operand is `long`, convert the other to `long`

We can force conversion with `(type) expression;` (cast). A cast does not change
the value of the expression.

Portable implementation for PRNG:
```C
unsigned long int next = 1;

/* rand: return pseudo-random integer on 0..32767 */
int rand(void)
{
    next = next * 1103515245 + 12345;
    return (unsigned int)(next/65536) % 32768;
}

/* srand: set seed for rand() */
void srand(unsigned int seed)
{
    next = seed;
}
```

### 2.8 Increment and Decrement Operators
With **prefix** (`++n`), n is incremented before its value is used). With
**postfix** (`n++`) n is incremented after its value is used.
Increment/Decrement operators *can only be applied to variables* (so you cannot
see 3++).
```C
/* strcat: concatenate t to end of s; s must be big enough */
void strcat(char s[], char t[])
{
    int i, j;

    i = j = 0;
    while (s[i] != '\0')               /* move to end of s */
        ++i;
    /*while (s[i++] = '\0');*/         /* similar */
    while ((s[i++] = t[j++]) != '\0')  /* copy t */
        ;
}
```

### 2.9 Bitwise Operators
Six operators for bit manipulations; only on integers (`char`, `short`, `int`,
`long`).
  * `&    (AND)`
  * `|    (OR)`
  * `^    (XOR)`
  * `<<   (left shift)`
  * `>>   (right shift)`
  * `~    (one's complement)`

`<< n` shift the bits to left by n positions, filling vacated bits with `0`.
Right shifting **unsigned** integer always fill with vacated bits with `0` while
it depends on the machine architecture for **signed** integers.

`~` converts each 1 to 0 and each 0 to 1. So `~0` is all 1 bits.

`n = n & 0177` sets all bits of `n` to 0 except the low-order 7 bits.
```C
/* getbits: get n bits (right) from position p */
unsigned getbits(unsigned x, int p, int n)
{
    /* ~(~0 << n) is a mask to keep the n rightmost bits (0000..11111).
       x >> (p+1-n) removes the rightmost (p-n) bits */
    return (x >> (p+1-n)) & ~(~0 << n);
}
```

### 2.10 Assignment Operators and Expressions
**Assignment operators** : like `+=`, `-=`, `|=`... The statement `x *= y + 1`
is equivalent to `x = x * (y + 1)`. (_preferable for conciseness and
readability_).
```C
/* bitcount: count bits set to 1 in x */
int bitcount(unsigned int x)
{
    int b;

    for (b = 0; x > 0; x >>= 1)
        if (x & 01)
            ++b;
    return b;
}

/* fastbitcount: count bits set to 1 in x, fast version */
int fastbitcount(unsigned x)
{
    int b;

    for (b = 0; x != 0; x &= x-1)
        ++b;
    return b;
}
```
In code above, we indicate that x is **unsigned** so when it is right shifted,
vacated bits are filled with `0`, not sign bit.

In two's complement number system, `x &= (x-1)` **deletes the rightmost 1-bit**
in x.

### 2.11 Conditional Expressions
`(expr1) ? expr2 : expr3` : evaluate `expr1`. If true, evaluate `expr2` else
evaluate `expr3`. Parentheses `()` around `expr1` are optional but easier to
read.
```C
z = (a > b) ? a : b;   /* z = max(a, b) */

/* print an array, 10 elements per line, each column separated by a blank space */
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    printf("%6d%c", a[i], (i%10 == 9 | i==n-1) ? '\n' : ' ');

printf("You have %d items%s.\n", n, n==1 ? "" : "s");
```

### 2.12 Precedence and Order of Evaluation
Operators precedence in decreasing order (the ones at the top have
high-priority) :
  * `() [] -> .`
  * `! - ++ -- + - * & sizeof`
  * `* / %`
  * `+ -`
  * `<< >>`
  * `< <= > >=`
  * `== !=`
  * `&`
  * `^`
  * `|`
  * `&&`
  * `||`
  * `? :`
  * `= += -= (all other assignment operators)`
  * `,`

In the expression `x = f() + g()`, the order of evaluation is not defined.
Sometimes `f()` is executed first, sometimes it's `g()`, so **be careful** if
one of them modify a variable also used by the other. We can store intermediate
result in a _temporary variable_ to ensure the order. **Don't do stupid
undefined behavior things** like `printf("%d %d", ++n, power(2, n))`.
