How would you test the word count program?

  With unit tests :
    * text with 10 words
    * empty text
    * text with only 1 long word (more than 50k chars)
    * text with 66k words (same line, test buffer overflow of 16bit int)
    * text with 66k words (1 per line, test buffer overflow of 16bit int)
    * text with some empty/blank lines between some lines with words

What kind of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

  * empty text
  * empty lines
  * lot of words (check overflow of int16 int)
  * text not empty but with only blank characters
