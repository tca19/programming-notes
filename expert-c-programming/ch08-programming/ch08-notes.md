Chapter 8 : Why Programmers Can't Tell Halloween from Christmas Day
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Potrzebie System of Weigths and Measures
Donald Knuth wrote *The Art of Computer Programming* and designed the TeX
typesetting system.

31 in octal is 25 in decimal, hence `OCT 31 = DEC 25` and programmers can't tell
the difference between Halloween and Christmas day. Moreover, `OCT 31 = NOV 27`.

### Making a Glyph from Bit Patterns
A black and white icon can be represented as series of integers, if we represent
black pixels with the value 1 and white ones with 0. In a program, these
integers correspond to the value of the bit pattern (like `10110` for `0x16`).
Some `#define` macros can help to represent hex values as an ascii art (see page
176 of the book).
