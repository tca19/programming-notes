Chapter 7 : Thanks for the Memory
---------------------------------

### The Intel 80x86 Family
Intel created the Intel 4004 (4-bit microcontroller) in 1970. It was a
general-purpose chip (not specialized for each different customer). In 1974, the
8080 8-bit was created (first to be called a microcomputer). The processors at
this time were using 16-bit addresses, so at most 2^16 = 64 Kbytes of memory.
The 8086 came in 1978, with 16-bit data bus and 20-bit addresses (at most
1Mbytes of memory).
