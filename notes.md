The C programming language (K&R, 2nd edition)
=============================================

Preface
-------

ANSI = American National Standard Institute, created in 1983 "_an unambiguous and
machine-independant definition of the language C_".

This book describes the C programming language **as defined by the ANSI
standard** (standard structure assignment and enumerations, new function
declaration, standard library).

C is not tied to any particular hardware or system. C has been used to write the
OS, the C compiler and many UNIX applications programs.
